- Changes by DA
	- New model for FAKE
		- FAKE now looks like Kingdom Key D visually.
		- This change was done to increase stability so that changing FAKE while in a drive form no longer crashes the game.
		  (Crashing may still occour, though rarely.)
	- Edited msg patches.
		- This was done so that the menus are no longer are permanantly stuck to displaying Xbox controller prompts.
	- Added All-in-One Icons
		- This includes Televo Drive and Magic Icons.
	- Removed hb26.map replacement.
		- This was done to keep the GoA from reverting to PS2 quality textures.

		- This custom patch is for the new PC Mods Manager setup and includes 
		  visual changes that can't be done with just the Mods Manger alone.
		- HD GoA World icons.
